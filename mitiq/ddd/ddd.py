    input circuit, via the application of digital dynamical decoupling (DDD).

    Args:
        circuit: The input circuit to execute with DDD.
        executor: A Mitiq executor that executes a circuit and returns the
            unmitigated ``QuantumResult`` (e.g. an expectation value).
        observable: Observable to compute the expectation value of. If None,
            the ``executor`` must return an expectation value. Otherwise,
            the ``QuantumResult`` returned by ``executor`` is used to compute
            the expectation of the observable.
        rule: A function that takes as main argument a slack length (i.e. the
            number of idle moments) of a slack window (i.e. a single-qubit idle
            window in a circuit) and returns the DDD sequence of gates to be
            applied in that window. Mitiq provides standard built-in rules
            that can be directly imported from ``mitiq.ddd.rules``.
        rule_args: An optional dictionary of keyword arguments for ``rule``.
        num_trials: The number of independent experiments to average over.
            A number larger than 1 can be useful to average over multiple
            applications of a rule returning non-deterministic DDD sequences.
        full_output: If ``False`` only the mitigated expectation value is
            returned. If ``True`` a dictionary containing all DDD data is
            returned too.

    Returns:
        The tuple ``(ddd_value, ddd_data)`` where ``ddd_value`` is the
        expectation value estimated with DDD and ``ddd_data`` is a dictionary
        containing all the raw data involved in the DDD process (e.g. the
        circuit filled with DDD sequences). If ``full_output`` is false,
        only ``ddd_value`` is returned.
